executiveSummary: "An introduction to the most clinically advanced frontier in SCI treatment. Neuromodulation moves beyond the 'cure' narrative to a 'functional' reality, using electricity to reawaken dormant neural circuits for mobility, hand function, and blood pressure control."

## The History
For decades, the dogma was "No Cure, No Hope." If you couldn't regrow the spinal cord, you couldn't recover. Neuromodulation flipped the script by asking: *“What if we don't need to regrow it? What if we just need to amplify the signal?”* This approach gained momentum with the "walking rat" experiments of the early 2010s and exploded in the 2020s as companies like Onward Medical and laboratories like NeuroRestore proved that paralyzed humans still had "silent" connections crossing their injuries.

## Key People
* **Prof. Grégoire Courtine**: The "Architect" from EPFL who discovered that specific stimulation protocols could enable paralyzed rats (and later humans) to walk.
* **Dr. Reggie Edgerton**: The "Godfather" of spinal stimulation whose work at UCLA laid the foundation for both epidural and transcutaneous therapies.
* **Dave Marver**: The CEO of Onward Medical, bridging the gap between academic breakthrough and a commercial product you can actually buy.

## The Story
This is a story of "Hardware vs. Wetware." While biologists struggle to fix the "wetware" (cells and nerves), engineers have hacked the "hardware" (the circuits). It focuses on the realization that a "Complete" injury is rarely 100% complete. There are almost always faint, dormant wires left. Neuromodulation is the amplifier that turns that faint whisper of a signal into a shout that the muscles can hear.

## Deep Dive: The Research & Mechanism
Neuromodulation works on the principle of **Sub-Threshold Stimulation**.

### 1. The "Ignition Key" (Epidural Stimulation / ARC-IM)
* **The Mechanism**: An implant is placed directly on the spinal cord. It delivers electricity to the **Central Pattern Generators (CPGs)**—ancient circuits in the lower spine that know how to walk but are asleep.
* **The Metaphor**: The car (legs) works, and the engine (CPG) is fine, but the driver (brain) lost the key. The stimulator hot-wires the engine so the car can run again.

### 2. The "Volume Knob" (Transcutaneous Stimulation / ARC-EX)
* **The Mechanism**: Non-invasive patches on the skin send electricity into the cord.
* **The Metaphor**: Imagine a radio signal that is too weak to hear (static). Transcutaneous stimulation turns up the volume on the spinal cord's receiver, allowing the brain's weak command ("move hand") to finally be heard by the muscles.
* **Status**: **ARC-EX** received FDA clearance in the US (2025/2026) for upper limb function, making it the first therapy of its kind to reach the mainstream clinic.

### 3. The "Digital Bridge" (BCI + Spine Interface)
* **The Future**: Connecting a brain implant (reading thoughts) directly to a spine stimulator (moving legs), bypassing the injury entirely. This closes the loop, restoring natural, thought-controlled movement.
