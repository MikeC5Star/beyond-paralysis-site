## Who they are
NervGen Pharma is a Canadian biotech developing **NVG-291**, a peptide targeting the receptor **PTPσ**. The goal is to reduce the inhibitory effects of molecules in the glial scar (notably **CSPGs**) and potentially “release the brakes” on growth and plasticity. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Where the science comes from
The drug concept traces back to work by **Dr. Jerry Silver** (Case Western), showing that blocking PTPσ could enable growth/sprouting through CSPG-rich scar in preclinical models. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Mechanism in plain English
After SCI, scar-related molecules can behave like “No Entry” signs for nerve signalling and regrowth. NVG-291 tries to interfere with that stop signal. It’s delivered **intrathecally** in trials (into spinal fluid). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Clinical progress
NervGen ran a trial called **CONNECT** (Phase 1b/2a), double-blind and placebo-controlled, including:
- **Chronic cervical incomplete** (AIS B/C, ~1–10 years post-injury)
- **Subacute cervical incomplete** (~4–24 weeks post-injury)

Treatment was delivered over **14 weeks** alongside intensive rehab. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Key results reported (June 2024)
- The trial reported an effect on a **biomarker of connectivity** using **TMS motor-evoked potentials** (signals to a hand muscle), described as stronger in the NVG-291 group vs placebo.
- **Functional outcomes** (hand function tasks) were **not statistically significant**, though there were trends and anecdotes.
- Safety looked good: no serious drug-related events were reported. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## What this means for SCI
This is important because it suggests **target engagement**: the drug appears to be doing something measurable in the nervous system. But it also shows the hard truth: better signals don’t automatically translate into reliable, clinically meaningful function within a short trial. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## What to watch next
The big questions:
1. Bigger trial with more power (more patients)?
2. Longer dosing or refined delivery?
3. Better matching of rehab/training to the new “signal potential”?

## Cautions
This approach likely favours **incomplete injuries**, where there are surviving pathways to strengthen or re-tune. For complete injuries, other strategies may be needed to create new connections first, then drugs like this might help refine them. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
