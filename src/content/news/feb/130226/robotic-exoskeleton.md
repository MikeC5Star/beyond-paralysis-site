title: "Walking Rehabilitation in Incomplete SCI: Evaluating Robotic Exoskeleton-Assisted Training"
pubDate: 2026-02-13
brief: "A clinical trial tested how robotic suits (exoskeletons) help people with partial spinal cord injuries learn to walk again. By comparing this to traditional therapy, researchers found that the robotic assistance significantly improved leg movement scores for participants within their first year of injury."
