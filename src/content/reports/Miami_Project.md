executiveSummary: "A 2026 executive update on the world's leading SCI research hub, highlighting the successful convergence of autologous Schwann cell transplants with state-of-the-art Brain-Computer Interfaces (Neuralink)."

## The History
Founded in 1985 by Dr. Barth Green and NFL legend Nick Buoniconti (following his son Marc’s injury), The Miami Project is the world’s most comprehensive SCI research center. For decades, their "North Star" was the **Schwann Cell**—a cell from the peripheral nervous system that can insulate and repair damaged nerves. After securing the first-ever FDA approval for these transplants in 2012, the Project has spent the last decade perfecting "combination therapies" that pair cell grafts with robotic exoskeletons and digital brain links.

## Key People
* **Dr. Barth Green**: Co-founder and Chief of Neurosurgery at UHealth, who remains the visionary lead.
* **Dr. Allan Levi**: Lead Principal Investigator for the Schwann cell trials and the Neuralink PRIME study at the Miami site.
* **RJ (Patient)**: A paralyzed veteran who, in April 2025, became the first Miami Project participant to receive a Neuralink implant, successfully regaining digital autonomy.

## The Story
The "Miami Model" in 2026 is about **Independence**. While biological cures are the long-term goal, the Project has pivoted to providing "Immediate Autonomy." This is best illustrated by the "Year of Telepathy" milestones, where patients with zero hand function are now using thought-controlled cursors to work, create 3D designs, and communicate. It is a story of turning "hopeless" cases into "active" participants in the digital world while the biological repair continues in parallel.

## Deep Dive: The Research & Mechanism
The Miami Project is currently managing three "Pillars of Repair" simultaneously:

### 1. The Cellular Bridge (Schwann Cells)
* **The Process**: Surgeons harvest a small sensory nerve from the patient's leg (Sural nerve), expand the **Schwann cells** in a clean-room lab for 3-5 weeks, and then re-inject them into the spinal injury.
* **2026 Update**: The Project has moved into the **Chronic Phase**, testing these transplants in patients who have been paralyzed for years. Recent data shows "conversion" (improvement in AIS grade) in a significant percentage of chronic subjects when combined with intensive "Boot Camp" rehab.

### 2. The Digital Bridge (Neuralink PRIME Study)
* **The Tech**: In 2025, Miami became the second U.S. site for Neuralink’s PRIME trial.
* **The Goal**: To allow patients with cervical (neck-level) injuries to bypass the spinal cord entirely by linking brain signals directly to computers and robotic arms.
* **Status**: As of June 2025, participants like RJ are using the "N1" implant to browse the internet and control smart devices via thought ("Telepathy").

### 3. Neuromodulation & Priming
* **Strategy**: Using **transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation** to "wake up" dormant nerve circuits. Miami researchers are now combining this stimulation with cell therapy to see if the "primed" spinal cord is more receptive to new cell grafts.
