title: "Profibrotic macrophage-derived CXCL4 promotes pericyte-to-myofibroblast transition after spinal cord injury"
pubDate: 2026-02-18
brief: "This study identifies a specific molecular trigger (CXCL4) that causes certain cells to transform into scar-forming tissue after a spinal cord injury. By understanding this mechanism, researchers hope to develop ways to block this transition and reduce fibrotic scarring, which currently acts as a major physical barrier to nerve regeneration."
