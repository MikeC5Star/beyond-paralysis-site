title: "Can paraplegics and tetraplegics walk again? The therapeutic potential of neural relay, synaptic organizers and subdural electrical stimulation for spinal cord injury"
pubDate: 2026-02-18
brief: "This article reviews advanced strategies to restore walking ability, focusing on 'neural relays' and synaptic organizers that can reconnect damaged nerve pathways. It also explores the potential of subdural electrical stimulation—a more direct form of stimulation beneath the spinal cord's outer membrane—as a powerful tool for functional recovery."
