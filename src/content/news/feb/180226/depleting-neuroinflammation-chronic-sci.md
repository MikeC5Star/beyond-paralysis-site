title: "Depleting non-resolving neuroinflammation in chronic spinal cord injury attenuates thermal hypersensitivity"
pubDate: 2026-02-18
brief: "Researchers tested a method to 'clear out' chronic, non-healing inflammation that lingers around spinal cord lesions long after the initial injury. By reducing the density of these inflammatory cells, they were able to significantly decrease hypersensitivity and chronic pain, offering a potential path for managing long-term symptoms."
