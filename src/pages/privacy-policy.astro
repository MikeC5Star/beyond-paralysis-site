			<p>Welcome to <strong class="text-white">Beyond Paralysis</strong> (beyondparalysis.uk). This website is a personal hub dedicated to sharing news, research, and personal updates related to Spinal Cord Injury (SCI).</p>
			<p>I believe in keeping things simple and transparent. This policy explains what little data this site collects, why it is collected, and how your privacy is respected.</p>

					1. What Information We Collect
				</h2>
				<p class="mb-3">This site is generally for reading and downloading research, so I do not collect personal information like your name, address, or phone number unless you explicitly email me.</p>
				<p class="mb-3">However, to understand how people use the site, we collect some basic, anonymous analytics data when you visit. This includes:</p>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-slate-400">
					<li><strong class="text-slate-300">Website usage:</strong> Which pages you read, how long you stay, and whether you download my research files (like PDFs).</li>
					<li><strong class="text-slate-300">Link clicks:</strong> If you click on links that take you to my YouTube videos or external SCI news articles.</li>
					<li><strong class="text-slate-300">General technical data:</strong> Your rough geographic location (e.g., country or city, but not your exact address) and what type of device or browser you are using. Your exact IP address is hidden and anonymized.</li>
				</ul>

					<span class="inline-block w-0.5 h-5 rounded-full bg-clinical-accent"></span>
					2. How We Collect It (Cookies)
				</h2>
				<p class="mb-3">We use a tool called Google Analytics, which is managed safely through Cloudflare Zaraz. This tool uses "cookies" — small text files placed on your device — to remember that you visited the site.</p>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-400">
					<li><strong class="text-slate-300">Your Choice:</strong> When you first visit the site, you will see a banner asking for your permission to use these analytics cookies. If you click "Reject All," we will not track your visit. It is entirely up to you.</li>
				</ul>

					3. Why We Collect This Data
				</h2>
				<p class="mb-3">The only reason I look at this data is to improve the site. Knowing which research articles are downloaded most often or which news categories get the most reads helps me understand what the SCI community finds most valuable so I can provide better content.</p>
				<p class="text-slate-400 font-medium">I do not (and will never) sell your data to advertisers or third parties.</p>

					4. External Links and YouTube Videos
				</h2>
				<p class="mb-3">This site contains links to other websites (like medical news sources) and embedded YouTube videos.</p>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-slate-400">
					<li>If you click a link to an external news site, you are leaving Beyond Paralysis, and their privacy policies will apply.</li>
					<li>Watching embedded YouTube videos on this site means Google/YouTube may collect their own data about your viewing habits according to their privacy rules.</li>
				</ul>

					5. Your Rights
				</h2>
				<p>Under UK data protection law (GDPR), you have rights regarding your personal data. Because the analytics data we collect is anonymized, we usually cannot identify you personally from it. However, you can always clear your browser cookies to reset your tracking preferences.</p>
