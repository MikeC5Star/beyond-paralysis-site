### The History: Releasing the Brakes
The discovery of NVG-291 stems from a fundamental question: *Why does the spinal cord fail to heal?*
* **1990s:** Dr. Jerry Silver (Case Western Reserve University) identifies the "Glial Scar" as the primary villain. Specifically, molecules called **CSPGs** (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans) act as "chemical glue" that traps nerve endings.
* **2000s:** The team discovers the receptor **PTPσ**—the "sensor" on nerve cells that detects the scar and shuts down growth.
* **2015:** A breakthrough paper in *Nature* demonstrates that a peptide (ISP) could switch off this sensor. Paralyzed rats treated with the peptide regained bladder control and locomotor function.
* **2025:** NervGen Pharma releases the first human data for NVG-291 (the clinical version of ISP), showing the mechanism translates to people.

### Key People
* **Dr. Jerry Silver:** The original inventor. His decades of persistence in studying the "glial scar" led to the identification of the PTPσ target.
* **Dr. Monica Perez:** The Principal Investigator at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. A world-renowned expert in neurophysiology who designed the rigorous "MEP" endpoints for the trial.
* **Dr. Daniel Mikol:** NervGen's Chief Medical Officer, who oversaw the translation from animal models to human clinical trials.

### The Story: Beyond the Numbers
The most compelling aspect of the CONNECT-SCI trial came from the patient exit interviews. While the lab measured electrical signals, patients reported life-changing "micro-victories" 12 months after taking the drug:
* **Independence:** Participants described being able to brush their teeth, open jars, or transfer into bed independently for the first time in years.
* **Bladder Control:** Several treated patients reported regained sensation or voluntary voiding—a top priority for the SCI community.
* **The "Sparks":** Patients described feeling new sensations and "connections" in their limbs. Crucially, these gains persisted long after the 12-week dosing period ended, suggesting the drug triggered permanent repair.

### Deep Dive: The Research & Mechanism
**Mechanism of Action: The "Wedge"**
After an injury, the body builds a scar filled with CSPGs. When a regenerating nerve hits this scar, the PTPσ receptor activates and essentially puts the nerve into a coma (dystrophic state).
* **NVG-291** acts as a molecular "wedge." It binds to the PTPσ receptor and prevents it from firing the "stop" signal.
* This allows nerves to grow *through* the scar and form new connections (plasticity).
* It also promotes **remyelination**, helping repair the insulation on surviving nerve fibers.

**Phase 1b Results (Chronic Cohort - June 2025)**
The trial tested the drug on individuals with chronic (1-10 years post-injury) cervical injuries.
* **Primary Endpoint Met:** Treated patients showed a **3-fold increase** in Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) amplitude in hand muscles compared to baseline (p ≈ 0.015). This is objective proof that the brain-to-muscle connection was physically strengthened.
* **Functional Trends:** Strong improvements were seen in the GRASSP hand function test (+3.7 points vs +0.4 in placebo).
* **Safety:** No serious drug-related adverse events. The drug was well-tolerated with only mild injection site reactions.

**What's Next?**
As of 2026, NervGen is completing the **Subacute Cohort** (treating patients 1-3 months post-injury). Plans are underway for a large-scale Phase 2b/3 pivotal trial, which could lead to FDA approval by the end of the decade.
