title: "Neonatal Spinal-Cord-Like Scaffold with Hierarchical Structural and Neurogenetic Microenvironments for Spinal Cord Injury Repair"
pubDate: 2026-02-18
brief: "This research introduces a 3D-printed bioactive scaffold that mimics the structure and chemical environment of a developing spinal cord. By creating a favorable 'micro-home' for nerve cells, this biomimetic approach aims to overcome the complex barriers to natural self-healing and promote functional repair after an injury."
