executiveSummary: "A comprehensive narrative analysis of the SCI therapeutics landscape as of late 2025. This report documents the industry's pivot from 'stabilization' to 'active restoration,' highlighting the dichotomy between Japan's regulatory speed and Western scientific rigor."

## The History
The SCI field has long been defined by a "Valley of Death"—the gap where promising rat studies fail in humans. However, late 2024 to 2025 marked a "Pivot Point." The era of simply trying to stop the injury from getting worse (neuroprotection) ended, and the era of trying to rebuild the cord (neuroregeneration) began. This transition is defined by the collapse of first-gen scaffold companies (like InVivo) and the rise of "smart" pharmacology and industrial-scale stem cell engineering.

## Key People
* **The Patient Traveler**: Represents the thousands engaging in "Regenerative Tourism," flying to countries like Japan for treatments not yet approved in the West.
* **XellSmart Team**: The scientists behind the first industrial-scale iPSC trial, moving cell therapy from "artisan" lab work to mass production.
* **Nipro Corporation**: The Japanese biotech giant behind *Stemirac*, the controversial but only approved stem cell therapy for SCI.

## The Story
The narrative arc of this report moves from the sterile, high-tech labs of Japan to the boardrooms of Delaware bankruptcy courts. It contrasts the "desperate hope" of patients mortgaging homes for unproven cures against the "clinical realism" of rigorous science. It highlights a fractured world: in Japan, a patient can legally buy a stem cell infusion called *Stemirac* that claims to repair the cord; in the US, that same patient is told to wait for better data. 

## Deep Dive: The Research & Mechanism
The report breaks the current landscape into three competing ideologies:

### 1. The "Drug Factory" (Stemirac/Honedra)
* **The Concept**: Instead of trying to grow new nerves, this therapy injects **Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs)** from the patient’s own bone marrow.
* **The Metaphor**: These cells don't become part of the wall; they are the "construction crew." They float to the injury and release chemical signals (growth factors) that tell the body to stop the fire and start repairing.
* **Status**: Conditionally approved in Japan; currently testing if it works in **Chronic** injuries.

### 2. The "Spare Parts" (XellSmart & Lineage)
* **The Concept**: Using **iPSCs (Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells)** or **OPCs** to manufacture specific replacements for lost tissue.
* **The Metaphor**: If the spinal cord is a stripped wire, **Lineage (OPC1)** is trying to re-wrap the insulation (myelin), while **XellSmart** is trying to 3D-print new copper wire (neurons) to bridge the gap.
* **Status**: Early-stage clinical trials (Phase 1) focused on safety.

### 3. The "Plasticity Enhancer" (NVG-291)
* **The Concept**: A drug that doesn't add cells but removes the barriers to growth.
* **The Metaphor**: The "glial scar" is like sticky glue that traps nerves. NVG-291 acts like a solvent, dissolving the "glue" (CSPGs) so the nerves can free themselves and reconnect.
