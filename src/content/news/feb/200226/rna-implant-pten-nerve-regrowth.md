title: "RNA-Activated Implant Promotes Nerve Regrowth After Spinal Cord Injury"
pubDate: 2026-02-20
brief: "Scientists have developed a 3D implant that carries RNA to silence the PTEN gene, which normally limits the body's ability to regrow nerves. This new strategy successfully boosts neuron regrowth, providing a promising path for repairing the spinal cord after serious injury."
