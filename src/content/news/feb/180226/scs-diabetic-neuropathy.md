title: "Structural and Functional Impact of Spinal Cord Stimulation in Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy"
pubDate: 2026-02-18
brief: "While spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is already used to manage chronic pain, this study investigates if the technology can actually modify the underlying disease pathology in diabetic neuropathy. The research looks at whether stimulation can go beyond pain relief to provide structural and functional benefits to damaged peripheral nerves."
