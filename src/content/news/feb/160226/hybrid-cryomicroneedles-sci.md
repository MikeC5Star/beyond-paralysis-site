title: "Hybrid Cryomicroneedles Enhance DC Vaccine Efficacy in Spinal Cord Injury"
pubDate: 2026-02-16
brief: "Researchers have developed a specialized microneedle system to deliver vaccines that boost the immune system's ability to protect nerve cells after a traumatic injury. This technology creates 'artificial structures' that provide ongoing neuroprotective immunity to prevent further nerve degeneration."
