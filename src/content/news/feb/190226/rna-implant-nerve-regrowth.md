title: "Researchers develop RNA-activated implant to stimulate nerve regrowth after spinal cord injury"
pubDate: 2026-02-19
brief: "Scientists have developed a new 3D implant that uses RNA-activated particles to encourage damaged nerve cells to regrow. This technology mimics the spinal cord's natural structure and delivers growth-promoting signals directly to the injury site, potentially overcoming the limited natural healing capacity of the central nervous system."
