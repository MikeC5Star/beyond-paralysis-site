executiveSummary: "A 2026 landscape analysis revealing a paradigm shift in treating Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD)—moving from reactive crisis management to predictive monitoring using AI wearables and 'closed-loop' spinal stimulation."

## The History
Historically, Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) has been the "orphan" of SCI research—treated as a symptom to be suppressed rather than a condition to be solved. For decades, the standard of care was primitive: "sit the patient up and remove the tight clothes." If that failed, doctors used "blunt" drugs like nifedipine that often caused dangerous blood pressure drops later. The last 24 months have seen a massive shift, driven by the discovery of the specific "neuronal architecture" that causes AD, allowing engineers to design devices that stop it before it starts.

## Key People
* **Dr. Andrei Krassioukov**: The "Godfather of AD research," whose work at ICORD (Canada) redefined AD not just as a blood pressure spike, but as a systemic threat to the heart and brain.
* **Dr. Aaron Phillips**: A pioneer in using electrical stimulation to stabilize blood pressure, turning the spinal cord’s own circuits against the dysreflexia.

## The Story
Imagine living with a fire alarm that could go off at any moment—during a date, a meeting, or sleep—threatening to cause a stroke because of a full bladder or a wrinkled sock. This is the reality of AD. The new narrative is about **Invisibility and Prediction**. It’s about "Silent AD"—the massive pressure spikes that happen while patients sleep, which they never feel but which slowly damage their hearts. The story of 2026 is the arrival of technology that makes this invisible threat visible (wearables) and manageable (smart stimulation).

## Deep Dive: The Research & Mechanism
The report identifies three major frontiers that are replacing the old "reactive" model.

### 1. The Neuronal Architecture & TESS
* **The Problem**: In SCI, the brain loses control of the "blood pressure dial." When a trigger happens below the injury, the spinal cord panics and cranks the pressure up to maximum, and the brain can't turn it down.
* **The Solution**: **Targeted Epidural Spinal Stimulation (TESS)**. This acts like a "local jammer." By stimulating specific spots on the spinal cord, devices can dampen the panic signal, stabilizing blood pressure in real-time without drugs.

### 2. The Invisible Enemy: Silent AD
* **The Discovery**: Using 24-hour monitoring, researchers found that patients suffer dangerous hypertension significantly more often than they realize.
* **The Tech**: New sensors like the **UroMonitor** (a wireless bladder sensor) and AI-driven skin sensors (measuring **SKNA** - Skin Nerve Activity) can predict an AD attack minutes before the blood pressure spikes, allowing for pre-emptive action.

### 3. Smart Pharmacology
* **The Shift**: Moving away from "blunt" vasodilators to precise drugs like **Mirabegron** (a Beta-3 agonist). Instead of crashing the whole system's blood pressure, these drugs specifically relax the bladder, removing the most common trigger of AD without the side effects.
